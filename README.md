# TerraBTC Protocol and TerraBTC Core Project

TerraBTC Core is a lightweight opensource project to store the true first minecraft virtual world fully on bitcoin blockchain, not as layer 2 but writing all world blocks as bitcoin transactions.
All the details of the protocol will be described in the whitepaper and it will all be mathematically programmed, just like bitcoin.
A Hex Id will be created for each version of the protocol, always inheriting all the properties of the genesis version "TB0001".
